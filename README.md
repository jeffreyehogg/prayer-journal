🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone & Install
Clone the repository and install the dependencies using pnpm (based on the pnpm-lock.yaml).

Bash

git clone https://github.com/jeffreyehogg/prayer-journal.git
cd prayer-journal
pnpm install
2. Set Up Your Supabase Project
Go to Supabase and create a new project.

Go to Project Settings > API.

Find your Project URL and your anon public key.

3. Set Up Environment Variables
Rename .env.example to .env.local.

Copy your Supabase URL and Key into .env.local:

Bash

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_PROJECT_URL_HERE
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=YOUR_ANON_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE
4. Set Up the Database Schema
Go to the SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard and run the following queries to create your tables and policies.

SQL

-- 1. Create the custom status type
CREATE TYPE prayer_status AS ENUM ('Pending', 'Praying', 'Answered');

-- 2. Create the 'prayers' table
CREATE TABLE public.prayers (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  status prayer_status DEFAULT 'Pending'::prayer_status NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid() NOT NULL,
  category TEXT,
  sort_order INTEGER,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY(user_id) 
  REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 3. Create the 'notes' table
CREATE TABLE public.notes (
  id BIGINT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL,
  content TEXT,
  prayer_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID DEFAULT auth.uid() NOT NULL,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY(user_id) 
  REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  
  CONSTRAINT fk_prayer FOREIGN KEY(prayer_id) 
  REFERENCES public.prayers(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 4. Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for both tables
ALTER TABLE public.prayers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.notes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 5. Create RLS Policies for 'prayers'
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own prayers"
ON public.prayers FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 6. Create RLS Policies for 'notes'
CREATE POLICY "Allow users to manage their own notes"
ON public.notes FOR ALL
USING (auth.uid() = user_id)
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
5. Configure Authentication
In your Supabase dashboard, go to Authentication > Providers.

Go to Authentication > URL Configuration and set your Site URL to http://localhost:3000 (for development) and add https://your-production-url.com (for deployment).

6. Run the App
You're all set. Run the development server:

Bash

pnpm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
